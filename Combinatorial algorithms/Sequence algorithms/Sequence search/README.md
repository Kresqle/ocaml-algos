Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a straightforward algorithm used to find a target element within a list by sequentially checking each element until a match is found or the end of the list is reached. The algorithm iterates through the list, comparing each element with the target value until either a match is found or the entire list has been traversed. In its basic form, linear search has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. It is often used for small lists or as a simple solution when the list is unsorted. However, for larger lists or when efficiency is crucial, other search algorithms like binary search or hash tables are preferred due to their faster search times.
