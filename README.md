# Algorithms in OCaml

An implementation of different algorithms in OCaml (list from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms), some might not be implemented yet).

## Broad definition of the term algorithm

An algorithm is fundamentally a set of rules or defined procedures that is typically designed and used to solve a specific problem or a broad set of problems.

Broadly, algorithms define process(es), sets of rules, or methodologies that are to be followed in calculations, data processing, data mining, pattern recognition, automated reasoning or other problem-solving operations. With the increasing automation of services, more and more decisions are being made by algorithms. Some general examples are; risk assessments, anticipatory policing, and pattern recognition technology.
